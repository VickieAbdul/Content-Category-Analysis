Number of employees: 250

Client background:

Social Buzz is a social media and content creation company that has gained popularity over the years. They emphasize their content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds.

Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively.

Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. 

The project was tackled by breaking it down into four tasks

Task 1

A brief from the client was read to:

Understand the client and business problem at hand.
Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
Identify which tasks you should focus on as a Data Analyst.

Task 2

From the 7 datasets given, the relevant datasets useful for the project were cleaned, and a model was created to combine the them. The relevant datasets were the "reactions", "content" and "reaction types" tables. The model creation was done in excel using the power query.

Task 3

Pivot tables were created for the analysis and an interactive dashboard was used for the visualization using excel.

Task 4

The presentation structure was planned to ensure the presentation answered the right questions. This was done on power point.

For each slide, the following were mapped out: 

Agenda - What will the presentation cover?
Project Recap - What are the key points from the brief?
Problem - What is the problem that will be answered in this presentation?
The Analytics team - Who is on the team?
Process - How was the analysis completed?



The conclusion:

Posts about animals usually have more positive reactions, this shows that most of the people easily relate with such contents.

Other categories that have the potential of experiencing a massive boost in  audience engagement are “healthy eating”, “Science”, and “Technology”. Followers' interests on these topics can be leveraged on by working with experts in those fields to bring originality to the contents.
